## Quantum Keypad

All the code can be found in [quantum_keypad/](quantum_keypad/) folder.

Here I used [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/).

[Video](https://youtu.be/EVqfnaaUThU) demonstration of quantum keypad.

## Joystick

All the code can be found in [mouse_controller/](mouse_controller/) folder.

`Server` was launched on MacBook and `client` was launched on [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/).

Raspberry Pi was used as a controller with joystick and water sensor (it simulates the pressing of Space bar).

Here you can find a [video](https://vk.com/video182954756_456239026) of this setup in action.
